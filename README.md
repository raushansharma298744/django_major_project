This is a simple and practical Helpdesk Ticket Management System built using Django and Django REST Framework. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to create, manage, and track support tickets inside an organization or team.

Users can report issues by creating tickets with a title and description. Each ticket can be assigned a priority level such as Low, Medium, or High, and its status can be updated as it moves from Open to In Progress, Resolved, or Closed. This helps in organizing and monitoring issues efficiently.

The project uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure the API endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage tickets. Pagination is also implemented to handle large numbers of tickets smoothly.

This project demonstrates the implementation of RESTful APIs, authentication, CRUD operations, and proper project structure using Django. It can be further improved by adding role-based access control, email notifications, and a frontend interface.
